# Spruce  Take Home
This was an interesting project that had me learning the basics of graphQL.
There are a bunch of tradeoffs I made to help speed up the development process.
I would be happy to talk  about the assignment and where I had difficulty and what parts I made tradeoffs in the interest of time.


Project was forked from an example project that I found on github.

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## First steps

Install dependencies using NPM:

```
npm install
```

Compile TypeScript:

```
npm run build
```

Run server locally:

```
npm start
```

## Experimenting

Navigating to the server URL (logged to output) opens a GraphQL playground, where you can explore the documentation and try executing queries and mutations.

If you wish to try out some code changes, run `npm run dev` and your server will relaunch automatically when you save a file.
